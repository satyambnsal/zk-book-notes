cryptosystems like RSA works on numbers, but messages are made up of characters. How should we convert our messages into numbers so that mathematical operations can be applied ?

The most common way is to take the ordinal bytes of the message, convert them into hexadecimal, and concatenate. This can be interpreted as a base-16/hexadecimal number, and also represented in base-10/decimal.


Properties of the XOR operation and then use them to undo a chain of operations that have encrypted a flag. 

There are four main properties we should consider when we solve challenges using the XOR operator

Commutative: $A \oplus B = B \oplus A$

Associative: $A \oplus (B \oplus C) = (A \oplus B) \oplus C$

Identity: $A \oplus 0 = A$
Self Inverse: $A \oplus A = 0$
