P vs NP

If you can effieciently find a solution to a problem, can you also effieciently verify it

1. Finding if a number is in array
$$
a = [23,4,5,6,7,17]
$$
check if 6 is part of the array or not
find the index of 6 in array a:
Solution in O(n)
a[3] = 6

P = problems which are easy to solve and easy to verify
1. Sort a list

```
l = [3,4,5,6,88,2]


check if l is sorted or not

let isSorted = true
for (i = 1 ; i < l.length; i++) {
if(l [i] !>= l[i-1]) {
  isSorted = false
  return
}


}


NP: Problems that be verified very quickly but not easy to compute

C = 23131232131313
Q: find two factors such that a * b = C

a = 133444
b = 2334555
a * b = c


ZK Proofs:
1. Scalability: ZK rollup(Starknet)
2. Privacy


2. Modular Airthmetic

23 % 7 = 2

1/3 = 0.333333333

(a/b) * b = a

M = 7

1 + 8 mod 7 = 2

(3 * 5) mod 7 = 1

3/5 mod 7 = x

3 * 1/5 mod 7


1/5 = x

x* 5 mod 7= 1

3 is the modular inverse of 5
